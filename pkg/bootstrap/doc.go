/*
The bootstrap package is an example of an add-on module to goradd. It contains bootstrap controls,
static files, examples, etc. but everything here is optional, they are not necessary to the basic
function of goradd. Not only is this a supported add-on, but its an example of how you can create
your own add-on controls to goradd, whether for your own use, or to publish for others to use.
