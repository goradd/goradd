// Package bootstrap is an add-on module that contains bootstrap controls,
// static files, examples, etc. but everything here is optional, they are not necessary to the basic
// function of goradd. Not only is this a supported add-on, but its an example of how you can create
// your own add-on controls to goradd, whether for your own use, or to publish for others to use.
