// BlueMondaySanitizer is a sanitizer based on microcosm-cc/bluemonday. BlueMonday is designed to sanitize input
// coming from a WYSIWYG HTML editor, so it has the annoying extra step of escaping HTML entities. We wrap the
// BlueMonday sanitizer in this structure so that we can unescape html entities before sending them to the textbox.
// We will still get all the stripping of javascript that the sanitizer normally does.
// If you want a different global sanitizer, change it here.
// Or, override the Sanitize function in the textbox object.
//
// This sanitizer is no longer used by default, because it removes too much valid text. For
// example, a<b is changed. So, you need to be careful to escape anything you are outputting to the
// browser instead.
