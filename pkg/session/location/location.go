// Package location implements a location queue built on top of the session service.
// You can use it to keep track of the path a user took to get to a particular location,
// and then allow that user to back out of that path. This is helpful in situations where
// there are multiple paths to get to a page, but the user presses a Save or Cancel button
// indicating the user wants to go back to whatever location they were previously at.
