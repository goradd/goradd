// Package control contains implementations of standard HTML controls in GoRADD.
// These controls generally fall under the following categories:
//
//   - Standard html tags. For example, div, input, select, table, img
//
//   - Controls specifically designed to edit database data, like INT, FLOAT or DATE fields
//
//   - Controls that we need to support the manipulation of database relationships, like one-to-many relationships
//
//   - Useful utility controls
//
//     See the [button], [textbox], [list], [table] and [dialog] packages for controls specific to these common types.
