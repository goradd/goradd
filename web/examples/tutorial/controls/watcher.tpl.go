<h1>Watching Database Changes</h1>
<p>
You can tell any control to redraw itself when a portion of the database changes. Usually, you will use this with
a list of items in the database so that if you or someone else edits an item in the list, you can see the changes in
real time. You can also

	buf.WriteString(`Different databases refer to data objects using different words, but the concepts are the same. For example,
in a SQL database a collection of objects corresponds to a &#34;table&#34; and a member variable in an object corresponds to a &#34;field&#34;.
Each object in a table has a member variable which contains a unique key to identify that object, called the &#34;primary key&#34;.
Relationships between two tables are defined using a &#34;foreign key&#34;, which is essentially just a member variable in one
object that contains a copy of the primary key of a different object.

	buf.WriteString(`For example, if a &#34;project&#34; object wanted easy access to the &#34;person&#34; object that is the manager of the project,
the &#34;project&#34; object could have a member called &#34;manager_id&#34;, which is the primary key of the &#34;person&#34; object
that contains information on the project&#39;s manager. Note that this sets up a one-to-many relationship, because
the project points to only one manager, but a manager might be managing multiple projects, and so will have multiple projects
pointing back to the manager.

This tutorial will teach you how to set up database relationships, and traverse them to create and retrieve the data you want.

If you have not yet set up the example database, do that now using the following steps.
