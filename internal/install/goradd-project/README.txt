goradd-project

Overview
--------
This is the project directory for a project based on the goradd framework.

This project directory contains user configurable files and files generated by the goradd build process.

This is where you add your business logic and build out your application.

Most of your application work goes into the "web" directory. It will contain the HTML pages, the javascript and css files,
the goradd forms, panels, and templates, and anything else you need to build the web side of the application.

The config directory contains configuration values required by the framework, but is also a convenient
place to put other configuration values that the rest of your application can access. The starting point of the
application development process is to create a SQL database and then setup your credentials in the config/db.go
file.

The codegen directory has the configurable code generator that turns your database tables into model structures
and default forms and panels. Those will get placed into the "gen" directory. To run the code generator, execute the
following from inside the codegen directory:

go generate build.go

Afterwards you will modify files in the gen/*dbname*/model directory, and copy out the default form and panel files
into the corresponding locations in the web directory to modify them there.

The tmp directory is used by the codegen process to put intermediate generation files.

The control directory is a convenient place to put custom controls that you create. By default, it contains a single
form_base.go file that all the form files inherit from, and that allows you to make site-wide settings for
all the forms.

The main directory contains the main launching point of the application and is what you should build to make the
application. Note that you should build the entire directory and not just the main.go file so that the build will
pick up the devInclude.go file.

The build directory contains scripts to build the final version of your application for deployment. The deploy
directory is used by the scripts to stage the various files that are part of the build process for final
packaging into the executable.

Building the Toolchain
----------------------
The first time you check out this project code, you will need to build the toolchain.

To create the toolchain to build this project, do the following:

1) If you haven't already, clone this project directory
2) Install Go
3) Install GoRADD with:
  go install github.com/goradd/goradd@latest
4) Install the postgres database found in db.sql in a database called "de_lab"
5) Create a postgres user "root" with password "12345" and assign all privileges for the new database
6) Install the other goradd tools needed by the build process by executing the following command from within the
   goradd-project directory:

   goradd install -d
