This directory contains user configurable files and files generated by the goradd build process. It is copied out of the
goradd directory and placed here so you can edit it. This is where you build out your application.

Most of your application work goes into the web directory. It will contain the HTML pages, the javascript and css files,
the goradd forms, panels, and templates, and anything else you need to build the web side of the application.

The config directory contains configuration values required by the framework, but is also a convenient
place to put other configuration values that the rest of your application can access.

The codegen directory has the configurable code generator that turns your database tables into model structures
and default forms and panels. Those will get placed into the gen directory. From there you will modify the models,
and copy out the default form and panel files into the corresponding locations in the web directory to modify them
there. The tmp directory is used by the codegen process to put intermediate generation files.

The control directory is a convenient place to put custom controls that you create. It contains a single
form_base.go file that all the form files inherit from, and that allows you to make site-wide settings for
all the forms.

The main directory contains the main launching point of the application and is what you should build to make the
applicaton. Note that you should build the entire directory and not just the main.go file so that the build will
pick up the devInclude.go file.

The build directory contains scripts to build the final version of your application for deployment. The deploy
directory is used by the scripts to stage the various files that are part of the build process for final
packaging into the executable.
