        # Use a database config file
        # The default db.cfg is useful in particular on Mac computers because of a limitation
        # of how the Docker Desktop works on the Mac. It allows the container to contact
        # the database running on the Mac host. In production, the db.cfg file is a good
        # place to put database credentials that you do not want to check in to source control.

        # the app to look for and use the db.cfg file. See config/db.go
